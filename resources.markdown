Feel free to copy and borrow ideas from our resources, all we ask is that you [let us know](https://frcpersevere.com/contact) if you found them helpful. All of our CAD Files are STEP files, if you have trouble opening them please [contact us](https://frcpersevere.com/contact). More resources are coming. Stay tuned!

## Mechanical/CAD
We use onshape to design and CAD all of our robots. We have created a document with links to all of features you need to know to start Onshape with your team.
1. [**Onshape Fundamentals**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EW8V7WBNBqr19iqDcAsuY5-3FRw1PEwA37WWa0JXmIY/edit?usp=sharing)

We created a 6 wheel colson West Coast drivetrain powered by 6 minicims. This is available for any teams to use and learn from.

Here is a full robot with a custom drivetrain, linear slide and electrical board. We had trouble on those systems in the past so we wanted to take time to create them for us to improve on and for other teams to learn from.
