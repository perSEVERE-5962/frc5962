## Join the team!

All students (from any school) who will be in grades 9-12 in the 2024-2025 school year are welcome to join! There is **no cost** to join! No experience is necessary! We understand that students may have other obligations, so attendance to every meeting is not required.  

## Overview of our schedule
**Build Season (January-February):** Design, build, and program a robot for the competition from scratch!  
**Competition Season (February-April):** Compete with your robot against teams from around the world!  
**Off-season (April-December):** Learn engineering, programming, and business skills through working on the robot and other activities! Compete with your robot at off-season events!
